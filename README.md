# Overview

This program scans through a list of directories and logs the content of the directory and summarizes the result into a small statistics.

The program contains two classes: scanLogger and DirectoryScanner. The scanLogger is introduced into the DirectoryScanner via dependency injection. The DirectoryScanner scans a valid directory while the scanLogger keeps useful data that it eventually prints out.

The program is useful in providing data about a given path. For instance, instead of digging through a complex directory, we can run the program and all relevant files and folders can be shown instantly.
